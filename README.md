This program is designed to teach Physics: Fluids
p5.js link: https://editor.p5js.org/Exp/sketches/72Q2OF-7t


For those who do not know,
Continuity Equation: A₁v₁ = A₂v₂
Bernoulli's Equation: P₁ + 0.5ρv₁² + ρgh₁ = P₂ + 0.5ρv₂² + ρgh₂


This program consists of 4 pages. Use left and right arrow keys to navigate between them.
Page 1: Start
Page 2: Summary of the two equations. (Beginner)
Page 3: Interactive simulation of Continuity Equation (Intermediate)
Page 4: Interactive simulation of Bernoulli's Equation (Advanced)

In the interactive simulations, you can select different variables to act as the dependent variable.
You can also vary the other variables to see how the dependent variable... varies.
